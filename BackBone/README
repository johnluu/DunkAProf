This is a basic skeleton for the upcoming game.
Right now it contains main class and a class that draws a target to be hit with the ball.

	TODO:
1. Classes for all other objects.
 a. World or stage.
 d. Professor.
And possibly others.

	HOWTO compile and run.
I tested this on linux.
1. Checkout the code using svn client: 
	svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/cisc-3140/
2. Navigate into the directory: 
	cd cisc-3140/Backbone/
3. Build the game:
	make
4. Run the game:
	./run.sh

This should work on any linux machine.
